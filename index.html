    <h2>definition of strength that not all humans have </h2>
  </center>
  <center>

    <p>

      is a physical vector quantity that is a measure of the impact on a given body from other bodies or fields . The application of force causes a change in the speed of the body or the appearance of deformations and mechanical stresses .
      Deformation can occur both in the body itself and in the objects that fix it - for example, springs.

      The action of other bodies on the body is always carried out by means of fields created by the bodies and perceived by the body in question. The various interactions come down to four fundamental ones ; according to the Standard Model of
      particle physics , these fundamental interactions ( weak , electromagnetic , strong, and possibly gravitational ) are realized through the exchange of gauge bosons .

      To denote force, the symbol F is usually used - from lat. fortis (strong).

      The most important physical law, which includes force, is Newton's second law . It states that in inertial reference systems the acceleration of a material point in direction coincides with the applied force, and in modulus is proportional to
      the modulus of the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the material point.

      The word "power" in Russian is ambiguous and is often used (alone or in combinations, in science and everyday situations) in meanings that differ from the physical definition of the term.
